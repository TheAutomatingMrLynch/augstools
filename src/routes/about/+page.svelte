		<p style:line-height="2rem">AUGS.Tools started in 2011 when I fell in love with and got addicted to TMNT AUGS. I quickly learned about the AUGS Facebook group created by Pete Walsh, and the community Discord.
			</p><p style:line-height="2rem">Everyone in the community was so passionate and excited about the game system -- the toys we had to play with. People were sharing their ideas for custom content.
			Some people were posting images of their new custom characters, others were designing elaborate scenarios to playthrough. You can find a lot of this custom content by digging through the Facebook page.
			</p><p style:line-height="2rem">It's full of amazing ideas, but it's a bit cumbersome to sift through it all on Facebook. I wanted something a little better.
			The creativity and kindness of the community inspired me to create a place where we could all create and share our...creations!
		</p>
		<p style:line-height="2rem">
			I started by creating a simple AUGS Co-Op tool, and then a Hero Builder.
			After a few years, I decided to create a website to host all of my tools, and AUGS.Tools was born.
